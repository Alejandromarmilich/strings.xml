## How to Change the Language Setting for Sketchware

### Option 1: I already have downloaded the translated strings.xml file.

If the file name is not `strings.xml`, rename the file from `strings_XX.xml` to `strings.xml`. (Note that `XX` in the file name can be any locale, en, kr...)

Copy and Paste the `strings.xml` file to `Device Storage -> sketchware -> localization`.

For me, I could find this folder under `sdcard/sketchware/localization` path, shown below:

Restart Sketchware, and you will see the message below:

### Option 2: I don't have the strings.xml file, and I have to translate it.

Use your favorite File Manager to navigate to the following directory:

`Device storage -> sketchware -> localization`

There will be a string file, `strings_provided.xml`, provided to you in this directory.

For me, it was under `sdcard/sketchware/localization`, shown below:

![](https://github.com/sketchware/strings.xml/blob/master/screenshots/localization.png)

Then, use your favorite text editor to open the `strings_provided.xml` file and translate it to your language.

After you're done modifying the string file, save it as `strings.xml`, and place it under the same directory as the `strings_provided.xml` file, which was under `.../sketcwhare/localization`.

When you restart Sketchware, you will see the message below:
